# DSA Solutions in Python

This repository contains my solutions to various Data Structures and Algorithms problems, primarily focusing on dynamic programming (DP), greedy algorithms, graphs, and trees. Each solution is implemented in Python.

## Overview

This repository serves as a collection of my solutions to common DSA problems. The solutions are categorized into the following sections:

- **Dynamic Programming (DP):** Solutions to problems that can be solved using dynamic programming techniques.
- **Greedy Algorithms:** Solutions to problems where greedy strategy works optimally.
- **Graph Algorithms:** Solutions to problems involving graph traversal, shortest paths, etc.
- **Tree Algorithms:** Solutions to problems related to binary trees, binary search trees, etc.

## How to Use

Each problem solution is provided in its respective directory. You can navigate to the specific directory to view the problem statement, solution explanation, and the Python code.
